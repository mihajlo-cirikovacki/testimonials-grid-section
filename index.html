            <blockquote class="testimonial__text testimonial__text--gray">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                weeks was the  best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve  
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</blockquote>

            <blockquote class="testimonial__text testimonial__text--light-gray-blue">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</blockquote>
